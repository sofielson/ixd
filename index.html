One day, our editors received a letter from a reader who suggested that instead of hiring a “fortune cookie” to cover the food scene that the P-I should have hired an American. Having grown up in Missouri, I assumed liberal, Pac-Rim-influenced Seattle would be a “safe” zone for me. Alas, the bubble is permeable. But my colleagues had my back.

Three years into the job, the company’s distributor from South Africa invited Teresa to attend a big beauty show in Africa. Her boss thought it was a great idea — Teresa could go and educate the nail techs on how to use the products as well as do demos at the show. “I felt very confident that I had enough experience, especially with the company’s products,” Teresa says. “I was very excited about it, and the distributor was very excited about it.

He hung up, and he turned to me — he just kind of blurted it out — he said, ‘That was the main office. They discussed it, and they said you’re too fat and too ugly to represent the company at the show in South Africa.’" “My heart dropped into my stomach," Teresa continues. "I was so shocked. He immediately started tripping over his words. He said, ‘Maybe the words were more like, unattractive and overweight’ — trying to soften the blow. But he wasn’t apologetic or anything. I wanted to hysterically cry my eyes out, but I didn’t want to show emotion in front of him. I didn’t want him to go back and tell them I had an emotional response to their decision.

"It was the second they saw the chair, or I declared I had a disability, that they would say \'we’ve found a better candidate\'. It was always the same loophole, she said.

              We all look different, that is a fact. Should our appearance really affect how much we earn, what kind of jobs we get and how we are treated in the workplace?
            </p>
            <p>
              We strongly believe that one of the things that makes you you, is the unique mix we all are of different people, gender, race, personality and appearances.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, people are still being discriminated against in the workplace due to the colour of their skin, gender, tattoos, piercings, hair color, scars etc.
  As Martin Luther King Jr said in 1963:
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="italic">
                "I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character”
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Still, 60 years later here we are… People are still being judged for everything except the content of their character: colour of their skin, gender, nationality, sexual orientation - you name it!
            </p>
            <p>
              With this project, we hope to highlight the struggles everyone goes through on a day-to-day basis, and evoke empathy for the minorities in the workplace. We hope that visitors will leave the installation feeling a bit better informed and ready to become the change we need for a more diverse, equal and inclusive workplace.
