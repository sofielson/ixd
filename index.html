During that time, I wrote about every kind of cuisine, local farmers, regional foodways, everyday foods, high-end foods – a good mix that hopefully offered a little something for everyone. One day, our editors received a letter from a reader who suggested that instead of hiring a “fortune cookie” to cover the food scene that the P-I should have hired an American. Having grown up in Missouri, I assumed liberal, Pac-Rim-influenced Seattle would be a “safe” zone for me. Alas, the bubble is permeable. But my colleagues had my back.

Three years into the job, the company’s distributor from South Africa invited Teresa to attend a big beauty show in Africa. Her boss thought it was a great idea — Teresa could go and educate the nail techs on how to use the products as well as do demos at the show. “I felt very confident that I had enough experience, especially with the company’s products,” Teresa says. “I was very excited about it, and the distributor was very excited about it. I got all the necessary shots, made sure my passport was up-to-date, and bought new clothes.”',r[1]='As it got closer to the date, Teresa pushed her boss to make the necessary travel arrangements. He emailed the main office to get approval, and a couple of days later, he got a phone call. Teresa remembers thinking something was off because her boss was being so quiet on the phone. “It was so surreal," she says. "I was standing by the fax machine. He hung up, and he turned to me — he just kind of blurted it out — he said, ‘That was the main office. They discussed it, and they said you’re too fat and too ugly to represent the company at the show in South Africa.’" “My heart dropped into my stomach," Teresa continues. "I was so shocked. He immediately started tripping over his words. He said, ‘Maybe the words were more like, unattractive and overweight’ — trying to soften the blow. But he wasn’t apologetic or anything. I wanted to hysterically cry my eyes out, but I didn’t want to show emotion in front of him. I didn’t want him to go back and tell them I had an emotional response to their decision. So I just sucked it up and said okay and went back to my desk.”',r[2]="My old boss was against body modifications because of her religious beliefs. I was constantly harassed about my piercings and tattoos. I had hours cut after getting my tattoos, even though they aren't visible. I have both feet done as well, but always wear socks and shoes.

One of my superiors advised me that if any of the pupils found out I am a lesbian, I would be sacked. I knew that the school had the power to do so, and it made me feel very uncomfortable and insecure. I had to be very careful about everything I said, making sure I never used the word ‘we’ when describing any activity or event in my life. I was forced to be constantly on my guard, in case I inadvertently implied that I had a partner or that I was in a same-sex relationship. This experience of discrimination continues to affect me today. Although I relate very well with young people, I have not worked with children since that time. This has restricted my employment options and stopped me from pursuing work in areas that I love. This discrimination also affects the community, because young people miss out on the positive qualities and input that I have to offer. Young people also get inaccurate and destructive messages when it is implied that all people are heterosexual, or when those who are not are silenced, as I was.

"I went into work and everything was fine, and then two hours into my shift, I got called into the office saying I\'m terminated because of my nails," explained Dominic Lopez, who has been wearing fake nails for the past three years without any issues. Everything changed, however, when he went into work wearing bright pink nail polish. His employers asked him to change the colour and shorten the tips, but despite doing so for his shift the following day, he was let go.<br />One of the managers said she knew that if Dominic returned to the store with fake nails again, he would be let go because it was against policy. When asked if that policy applied to both genders, the manager said, "It\'s because he\'s a guy."<br />While we would understand if he was let go because he was breaking established rules, it seems that Dominic (who plans to fight the firing) was just expressing himself — something no one had an issue with for three years. And considering he was coming up on his 10-year anniversary with the company, he was a loyal, hardworking employee.',r[6]='A pregnant Washington woman says she was fired from her job because she is pregnant. Kameisha Denton, who lives in Marysville, was told by text message on Tuesday night that she had lost her position at a Jersey Mike\'s restaurant.<br />The 19-year-old published a screenshot of the text message exchange on her Facebook account. The manager, who is saved in her phone as "Marcos," replied with a termination message. "Hello I am sorry to inform you but it\'s not going to workout with Jersey Mikes [sic]," Marcos wrote. "It\'s not a good time for us to have someone who is leaving for maternity leave in several months anyway. You also failed to tell me this during our interview. Good luck to."<br />Denton replied: "This is extremely unprofessional. You told me it was fine to be gone for 4 weeks and you guys have plenty of workers to last you until I get back. I feel lied to and betrayed. I hope you know I will be letting corporate know about this and I will not turn in my stuff because this is so unfair."<br />Marcos\' reply was simply: "Have a great day."<br />The store\'s owner Tim Trieb said the manager has since resigned from his position. Trieb attempted to give Denton her job back and apologized, but she declined the offer. "I told him I wasn\'t interested," she said. "Just because, I feel like that\'s just a way for me to hush with the situation, and it\'s wrong. You don\'t do that to somebody when they\'re willing to work to support their baby. I\'m capable of.

I was very good at my job, but found it difficult just to get invites to meetings, let alone extra work opportunities on projects. I wasn’t meeting customers; I was very much hidden in the background. At the time, I didn’t realise why that was. I thought I just needed to build my network.”<br />Then Louise started losing weight, down to a size 12. Suddenly, she found she got more opportunities at work: “Within 12 months of losing weight, I’d gone from managing six people to managing 100 people. I was in front of the more senior board members, whereas I didn’t have access to them before. It was a lift in my career.”<br />But she didn’t give any thought to the reason until a male colleague told her that, as a “fat bird”, she hadn’t been management material. “In his stupidly honest candour, he said at that time I wasn’t suitable for putting in front of customers.

She said, "I\'m disabled and have been rejected for more than 500 jobs in 18 months." Research reveals there are one million unemployed disabled people in the UK who want to work, according to the Office of National Statistics. At one interview she was asked why she didn\'t "just stay on benefits". Lucy is suffering from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome that makes her joints very loose and prone to dislocation. "It was the second they saw the chair, or I declared I had a disability, that they would say \'we’ve found a better candidate\'. It was always the same loophole, she said.

I’m a businesswoman and I wear smart dresses to work, so that would look stupid. I suggested covering it with a sticking plaster, but thought that would look unprofessional and draw attention to it," Jo explained.<br />The entire situatuon took a turn when she showed up for work only to have her contract terminated and being escorted from the building.

When Tristan then refused to sign the document stating that his "preference to act and dress as male" was not "in compliance with company policies," he was fired.

              <p>
  We all look different, that is a fact. Should our appearance really affect how much we earn, what kind of jobs we get and how we are treated in the workplace?
              </p>
              <p>
  We strongly believe that one of the things that makes you you, is the unique mix we all are of different people, gender, race, personality and appearances.
              </p>
              <p>
  As Martin Luther King Jr said in 1963:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="italic">
  “I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character”
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
  Still, 60 years later here we are... People are still being judged for anything except the content of their character.
              </p>
              <p>
  With this installation, we hope to showcase the power that companies have over our appearance, highlight the struggles everyone goes through on a day-to-day basis, and evoke empathy for the minorities in the workplace. We hope that you will leave the installation feeling a bit better informed and ready to become the change we need for a more diverse, equal and inclusive workplace.

                  According to a study conducted by Pew Research in the U.S earlier this year, about four-in-ten US adults say it has become more common for people to express racist views towards Asians since the pandemic began:
                  </p>
                  <p>39% said others have acted uncomfortably around them</p>

                  <p>In the UK, the percentage of obese adults increased from 15% in 1993 to 27% in 2015, by which time 58% of women and 68% of men were designated overweight. All over the world, countless studies reveal that overweight employees face widespread prejudice.</p>

                  <p>To begin with, they are less likely to be hired for a job. In a 2016 study led by the psychologist Stuart W Flint of Sheffield Hallam University, participants were asked to evaluate candidates for different types of jobs. Shown hypothetical CVs with photographs depicting fat and thin people, the participants clearly perceived men and women of average weight to be the most suitable for employment. Obese women were the least likely to be hired. The researchers concluded that stereotypes of obese people being “less physically capable and slothful” were likely to have played a role in this outcome.</p>

                  <p>Earlier this year, University of Pennsylvania researchers concluded that obese people are stereotyped as being “lazy, incompetent, unattractive, lacking willpower and to blame for their excess weight”.</p>

                    More than 1 in 4 employees have experienced discrimination due to their looks. Looks have an impact on our professional lives: 86% of the employees surveyed by Univia believed physical appearance matters in the workplace. Overwhelmingly, respondents noted that appearance is an essential component of career success. Some of the top held beliefs included:</p>

                  <p>Appearance influences client perception and company image (90%)</p>
                  <p>Appearance affects employee confidence (85%)</p>
                  <p>Appearance affects employee competency (73%)</p>

                  <p>According to statistics gathered by <a href="https://moderngentlemen.net/tattoos-in-the-workplace-statistics/">moderngentlemen.net</a> - even though the modern workplace is becoming more tolerant of diversity, tattoos including, with each passing year. But still, we have a long way to go. Just have a look at the current statistics:</p>

                  <p>63% of people over 60 don’t approve of tattoos in the office.
                  More than half of the general population considers tattooed individuals as lacking in seriousness.
                  Millennial parents approve in 70 percent of people with tattoos in child care.
                  Only 23% of employers will employ a professional regardless of the number and location of their tattoos.
                  Workplace diversity is greatly affected by tattoo discrimination in the recruiting process.</p>
