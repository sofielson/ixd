Three years into the job, the company’s distributor from South Africa invited Teresa to attend a big beauty show in Africa. Her boss thought it was a great idea — Teresa could go and educate the nail techs on how to use the products as well as do demos at the show. “I felt very confident that I had enough experience, especially with the company’s products,” Teresa says. “I was very excited about it, and the distributor was very excited about it.

He hung up, and he turned to me — he just kind of blurted it out — he said, ‘That was the main office. They discussed it, and they said you’re too fat and too ugly to represent the company at the show in South Africa.’" “My heart dropped into my stomach," Teresa continues. "I was so shocked. He immediately started tripping over his words. He said, ‘Maybe the words were more like, unattractive and overweight’ — trying to soften the blow. But he wasn’t apologetic or anything. I wanted to hysterically cry my eyes out, but I didn’t want to show emotion in front of him. I didn’t want him to go back and tell them I had an emotional response to their decision. So I just sucked it up and said okay and went back to my desk.”';

I had to be very careful about everything I said, making sure I never used the word ‘we’ when describing any activity or event in my life. I was forced to be constantly on my guard, in case I inadvertently implied that I had a partner or that I was in a same-sex relationship. This experience of discrimination continues to affect me today. Although I relate very well with young people, I have not worked with children since that time. This has restricted my employment options and stopped me from pursuing work in areas that I love. This discrimination also affects the community, because young people miss out on the positive qualities and input that I have to offer.

Everything changed, however, when he went into work wearing bright pink nail polish. His employers asked him to change the colour and shorten the tips, but despite doing so for his shift the following day, he was let go.<br /><br />One of the managers said she knew that if Dominic returned to the store with fake nails again, he would be let go because it was against policy. When asked if that policy applied to both genders, the manager said, "It\'s because he\'s a guy."<br /><br />While we would understand if he was let go because he was breaking established rules, it seems that Dominic (who plans to fight the firing) was just expressing himself — something no one had an issue with for three years. And considering he was coming up on his 10-year anniversary with the company, he was a loyal, hardworking employee.';

"It\'s not a good time for us to have someone who is leaving for maternity leave in several months anyway. You also failed to tell me this during our interview. Good luck to."<br /><br />Denton replied: "This is extremely unprofessional. You told me it was fine to be gone for 4 weeks and you guys have plenty of workers to last you until I get back. I feel lied to and betrayed. I hope you know I will be letting corporate know about this and I will not turn in my stuff because this is so unfair."<br /><br />Marcos\' reply was simply: "Have a great day."<br /><br />The store\'s owner Tim Trieb said the manager has since resigned from his position. Trieb attempted to give Denton her job back and apologized, but she declined the offer. "I told him I wasn\'t interested," she said.

I wasn’t meeting customers; I was very much hidden in the background. At the time, I didn’t realise why that was. I thought I just needed to build my network.”<br /><br />Then Louise started losing weight, down to a size 12. Suddenly, she found she got more opportunities at work: “Within 12 months of losing weight, I’d gone from managing six people to managing 100 people. I was in front of the more senior board members, whereas I didn’t have access to them before. It was a lift in my career.”<br /><br />But she didn’t give any thought to the reason until a male colleague told her that, as a “fat bird”, she hadn’t been management material. “In his stupidly honest candour, he said at that time I wasn’t suitable for putting in front of customers.

            <h1>The Human Cocktail</h1>
            <p>
We all look different, that is a fact. Should our appearance really affect how much we earn, what kind of jobs we get and how we are treated in the workplace?
            </p>
            <p>
We strongly believe that one of the things that makes you you, is the unique mix we all are of different people, gender, race, personality and appearances.
            </p>
            <p>
As Martin Luther King Jr said in 1963:
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="italic">
“I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character”
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
Still, 60 years later here we are... People are still being judged for anything except the content of their character.
            </p>
            <p>
With this installation, we hope to showcase the power that companies have over our appearance, highlight the struggles everyone goes through on a day-to-day basis, and evoke empathy for the minorities in the workplace. We hope that you will leave the installation feeling a bit better informed and ready to become the change we need for a more diverse, equal and inclusive workplace.
            </p>
